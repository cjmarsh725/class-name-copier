# class-name-copier
An extension that makes it easier to create CSS classes from JSX classNames. Place the cursor on a class defined in your JSX and activate the command ("extension.classNameCopier", default keybinding is Ctrl+Shift+Alt+C). The class name will be copied to the end of the CSS file of the same name and in the same directory as your component javascript file.
